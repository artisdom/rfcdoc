This document describes a set of tools for formatting RFCs, Internet
Drafts, and other documentation, collectively called &quot;rfcdoc&quot;.

    <t>
In the NETCONF/NETMOD working groups, we&apos;ve been using some simple
tools to ease the production of Internet Drafts and RFCs.  I use
the same tools for various open source projects (libxo, libslax,
juise).  The goals are simple:
    </t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
 <t>
Humans should never write XML; it&apos;s a fine language for machine
interchange, for making people write it directly is just plain mean.
 </t>
 <t>
Text should be email friendly.  We all use email to talk/review,
so having non-text formats make no sense.
 </t>
 <t>
There are existing text conventions (even twenty plus years ago when
I first wrote these tools) to allow semantic formatting.
 </t>
 <t>
When they aren&apos;t, we can roll-our-own easily enough.
 </t>
 </list>
</t>
    <t>
With those simple goals, let me introduce our tools.
    </t>
    <t>
If you lack the patience to weed through all these details, feel free
to skip directly to the &quot;how to&quot; instructions locatated in <xref target="how-to"/>.
    </t>
</section>
<section title="oxtradoc" anchor="oxtradoc">
    <t>
&quot;oxtradoc&quot; is the main tool, which turns text into &quot;xml2rfc&quot;-style XML
content.  &quot;oxtradoc&quot; stands for &quot;outputs xml to rfc and
documentation&quot;.  Not the best name, but at least I didn&apos;t call it
&quot;doccer&quot;.
    </t>
</section>
<section title="xml2rfc" anchor="xml2rfc">
    <t>
&quot;xml2rfc&quot; is a python script that turns XML of a certain format into
RFC-style text.  It&apos;s very good at what it does and I&apos;m so glad I
didn&apos;t have to write it.
    </t>
    <t>
By far the most pertinent fact about xml2rfc here is that we don&apos;t
ever need to hand-write XML content for it.  It is used to process XML
generated by oxtradoc.
    </t>
</section>
<section title="pyang" anchor="pyang">
    <t>
Everyone&apos;s favorite open-source YANG compiler, with a plug-in facility
that allows various output targets.
    </t>
</section>
<section title="make" anchor="make">
    <t>
&quot;make&quot; is the glue that holds it all together.  The file &quot;rfcdoc.mk&quot;
spells out the dependencies and commands that get the tools invoked
correctly.
    </t>
    <t>
There are &quot;make&quot; targets for producing the final documents, as well as
checking the content of YANG modules and example data files.  &quot;YANG
tree&quot; files can also be automatically generated.
    </t>
    <t>
Together these tools allow RFC authors to simplify their workload, be
more productive, make fewer mistakes, and generate more accurate and
useful drafts.

<section title="Headings, References, and Outline/Org Mode" anchor="headings-references-and-outlineorg-mode">
    <t>
Emacs has a mode called &quot;outline mode&quot;, which allows organization of
text.  Another mode called &quot;org mode&quot; extends this mode with
additional formatting conventions.  Refer to the documentation below:
    </t>

<t>    <eref target="https://somedocs-go-here">https://somedocs-go-here</eref></t>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
 <t>
Headings are in Emacs &quot;outline mode&quot;, where heading depth is
indicated a leading series of asterisks (&quot;*&quot;).  The more asteriskss,
the deeper the heading.

<t>
 <list style="symbols">
 <t>
&quot;outline mode&quot; has numerous functions for displaying and traversing
these hierachies.  &quot;org mode&quot; is a super set of &quot;outline mode&quot; and can
be used similarly.  See <eref target="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OutlineMode">https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OutlineMode</eref>
and <eref target="http://orgmode.org">http://orgmode.org</eref> for details.
 </t>
 <t>
References can be make to URLs, anchors (headings), or external
references.  A reference uses the convention of the target surrounded
by up-hats:

        </figure>
<t>
 <list style="symbols">
 <t>
Headings can be used as the anchors.  An explicit anchor name can be
provided by placing the name at the end of the heading line between
&quot;at&quot; signs (&quot;@&quot;), e.g. &quot;@anchor&#8209;name@&quot;.
 </t>

<t>
 <list style="symbols">
 <t>
If no explicit name is given, the anchor name will be the heading
content with the following conversions:
  <list style="symbols">
  <t>
Upper case is translation into lower case.
  </t>
  <t>
Spaces are translated into dashes (&quot;&#8209;&quot;).
  </t>
  <t>
Any non-alphanumeric characters besides dash and underscore are removed.
  </t>
  </list>
 </t>
 <t>
A reference to an internal anchor is translated to the section
number of the anchor&apos;s heading, prefixed with the word &quot;Section&quot;,
e.g. &quot;Section 4.2.1&quot;.  To suppress the prefix, use dual uphats:

  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.  We have come to
  dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for
  those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.

  It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But
  in a larger sense we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate --
  we can not hallow -- this ground.  The brave men living and dead
  who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to
  add or detract.

  The world will little note nor long remember what we say here but
  it can never forget what they did here.  It is for us the living
  rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
  fought here have thus far so nobly advanced

Digressions are sub-blocks of texts that don&apos;t appear in the RFC.
There are three types of digressions: document blocks, references
blocks, and open questions.
    </t>
    <t>
A digress begins with a line that starts with two open braces (&quot;{{&quot;)
followed by the name of the block and a colon (&quot;:&quot;).  The digress ends
with a line containing two close braces (&quot;}}&quot;).

Document values are taken from both the document section and the

following section lists the name, options, and contents of the
variables fields within the document digression:
    </t>

<section title="Open Question Digressions" anchor="open-question-digressions">
    <t>
A &quot;open question&quot; digress is used to record an open question within
the document for the benefit of the document authors.  The question
should be resolved before publication.  An open question can be
entered using a &quot;question&quot; digression, or may appear in a line
that starts with a question mark.

</section>
<section title="References Digressions" anchor="ref-back">
    <t>
External references are handled by oxtradoc using a two-phase
approach.  Typically a &quot;refences.txt&quot; file is created by the document
author that lists the references used in the document.  The digression
can appear directly in the document, but there is some significant
processing involved in turning this simple list into the complex and
verbose XML that xml2rfc needs for references.  &quot;oxtradoc -m mkback&quot;
turns a references file (&quot;references.txt&quot;) into a suitable XML file
(&quot;references.xml&quot;).  The Makefile for rfcdoc handles this dependency
automatically.
    </t>
    <t>
The format of the references file is a digression with the name
&quot;references&quot;.  The digression contains a &quot;title&quot; and a series of
reference names.  The title for a references digression can be
&quot;Normative References&quot; or &quot;Informative References&quot;:

<section title="How to Use these Tools" anchor="how-to">
    <t>
This section contains the simple steps for building your RFC.  In
these examples, replace MYNAME with your github login and MYDRAFT
with that name of your draft.
    </t>
    <t>
Avoid the desire to use the words &quot;draft&quot; or your own name in
the name of your draft, since this will hopefully be temporary and
your draft will be accepted by a working group, and eventually
published.  Once it&apos;s an RFC, having the base document be called
&quot;draft&#8209;phil&#8209;magic&#8209;cookies.org&quot; would be bad.  Best to start naming
it &quot;magic&#8209;cookies.org&quot; from the start.

        <t hangText="Fork the rfcexample repo">
Visit the https://github.com/philshafer/rfcexample and click on the
&quot;Fork&quot; button in the upper right.
 </t>
        <t hangText="Rename the repo to something appropriate">
Under &quot;Settings&quot;, enter the new name for your repo, MYDRAFT.
If you want to use github to track issues with your draft (a fine
idea), the select &quot;Issues&quot; under the &quot;Features&quot; list.  Then click on
the &quot;Rename&quot; button.
 </t>
        <t hangText="Clone the rfcexample repo">
On your laptop, make a local copy of the repo (aka &quot;clone&quot;) by using
the &quot;git clone&quot; command.  Note that the need the &quot;&#8209;&#8209;recursive&quot; flag
to ensure that the submodules rfcdoc uses are fully populated.

        <t hangText="Build the rfcdoc repo">
The rfcexample repo (and now your MYDRAFT repo) contains a set of
submodules containing captive copies of the required tools.  This
is for simplicity and ease-of-use, but also keeps things stable.
You need to build these tools using the following command:
 </t>
 </list>
</t>
        <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
    sh rfcdoc/install.sh
            ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
    <t>
Resolve any errors before continuing any further.  If the tools
are not installed correctly, nothing will work, so be sure this
step is done properly.

        <t hangText="Rename the starting point document">
Your repo has a copy of a document meant to help you get started,
but you&apos;ll need to rename it before continuing:
 </t>
 </list>
</t>
        <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
    git mv rfcexample.org MYDRAFT.org
    git commit -m 'Rename' MYDRAFT.org
    git push
            ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
<t>
 <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Edit your Makefile">
The Makefile under your new repo has a few variables that direct
the operation of the tools.  The first two are vital, and the rest
can be used as your document grows.  The &quot;draft&quot; variable is the
name of your input document, so it should be set to &quot;MYDRAFT.org&quot;.
The output_base is the basename of your output document, and that
value will depend on the working group, status, and topic of your
document.  For now, we&apos;ll use &quot;draft&#8209;MYNAME&#8209;MYDRAFT&quot;.  The remaining
variables should be empty.  The last two lines of the file should not
be changed, since they allow us to find your copy of rfcdoc.
